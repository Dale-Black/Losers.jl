## `dice_loss`
```julia
dice_loss(input, target; smooth_nr=1e-5, smooth_dr=1e-5)
```
Simple dice loss function. Penalizes based on the overlap between predicted `Å·` and ground truth `y`.
A Dice coefficient of 1 corresponds to perfect overlap and is equal to a Dice loss of 0.
A Dice coefficient of 0 corresponds to no overlap and is equal to a Dice loss of 1.

#### Arguments
`input`: input array
`target`: target array
`smooth_nr`: a small constant added to the numerator to avoid zero.
`smooth_dr`: a small constant added to the denominator to avoid nan.
